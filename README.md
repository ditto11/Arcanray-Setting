# Welcome to Arcanray

Arcanray is the world this campaign takes place in. The three continents of Arcanray are Anduli, Mialzapan, and Ernst. Ernst has been an isolated continent away from the populated areas of Mialzapan and Anduli. Its isolation has meant the dominance of monsters, monstrous races (such as gnolls, giants, and kuo-toa), and only the most powerful humanoids. It is only with recent advancements in magic and technology that humanoids have made their attempts to move into the continent.
